# OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand how network protocols and communication systems work. It consists of seven layers, each responsible for specific functions:

## 1. Physical Layer
- Deals with physical connections and transmission of raw data bits over a physical medium.
- Examples: Ethernet cables, optical fibers.

## 2. Data Link Layer
- Responsible for data framing, error detection, and physical addressing.
- Examples: Ethernet, Wi-Fi.

## 3. Network Layer
- Handles routing, logical addressing, and packet forwarding.
- Examples: IP (Internet Protocol).

## 4. Transport Layer
- Ensures end-to-end communication, reliability, and error correction.
- Examples: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

## 5. Session Layer
- Manages session establishment, maintenance, and termination.
- Examples: NetBIOS, RPC (Remote Procedure Call).

## 6. Presentation Layer
- Deals with data translation, encryption, and compression.
- Examples: SSL/TLS, JPEG, GIF.

## 7. Application Layer
- Provides user interface and application-level services.
- Examples: HTTP, SMTP, FTP.

Each layer of the OSI model builds upon the functionality of the layers below it, creating a structured framework for understanding network communication.
